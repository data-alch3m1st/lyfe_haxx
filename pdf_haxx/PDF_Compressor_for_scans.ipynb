This excludes many libraries, including most of the good PDF libararies, including pdfplumber, fitz, etc. Numerous tests on an iOS device using Carnets all failed. Any libraries able to run were unable to handle the compression/ conversion and resulted in either files of the same exact size or files which were tiny but had none of the original content; (literally nothing; completely blank).`"
