       "'9 Covert Action as Policy Support Meddling secretly in other people’s internal politics is distasteful; it is so much at odds with our domestic arrangements and values. On the other hand, however much Americans might like it otherwise, the world frequently a nasty place. If we are to compete, it often seems, is we may have to be just as nasty as our adversaries. —Gregory Treverton, Covert Action It is true that the CIA’s biggest mistakes involved covert action. But it is also true that these mistakes, without exception, also involved operations carried out at the behest of presidents pursuing flawed policies. And for every covert action that failed spectacularly, there have been others that enabled presidents and policymakers to achieve ends in the nation’s interest with an unseen hand, which is almost always preferable to a heavy footprint. —Jack Devine, former CIA senior official responsible for numer- ous covert operations This chapter will explore the CIA’s role as a policy implementer, when it conducts .sse covert action in support of special operations at the direction of the president.

Covert action is the one area in which the CIA participates as an influential deci- sion-maker that executes policy, which gives it a special stake in how policy is fash- ioned. At the same time, the CIA operates under strict guidelines, requiring far more presidential involvement and congressional notification than is required for the US military when it conducts its own special operations. This chapter will examine the  205purposes, scope, and processes involved in covert action. In particular, it will exam- ine the roles the president, the NSC, and Congress play in providing accountability and oversight. Some of the major successes and failures, along with lessons learned, will be examined. Finally, the chapter will highlight special challenges that covert action presents for the CIA and the US government more generally. WHAT IS COVERT ACTION? Covert action, in the American context, has evolved over time to describe a range of measures taken by the US government in which its role is designed to be hidden or deniable. According to section 503 (e) of the National Security Act of 1947, covert action is “an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence politi- cal, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.” As will be detailed later, such operations can be long- or short-term, of a military, diplomatic, or economic character, and involve very little or very large amounts of resources and people. It all depends on the goals set out by the president and his or her advisers. When the Cold War broke out in the late 1940s, President Truman and his advis- ers were much concerned about Soviet subversion taking place in Europe. Moscow’s involvement in the 1946–49 Greek Civil War, the Soviet-sponsored coup overthrow- ing the Czechoslovak government in 1948, and the rising influence of communist parties in Western Europe prompted Washington to find countermeasures. George Kennan, the father of the emerging US containment policy as well as a drafter of the Marshall Plan for Europe, was among those recommending immediate political war- fare. Hand in hand with the publicly announced Marshall Plan to aid weak European economies, Truman approved NSC-4/A, a directive that authorized secret “psycho- logical warfare” by the CIA as a government “service of common concern.” Among other things, the CIA provided funds to Christian Democratic parties in Italy and France to support their electoral campaigns to defeat resurgent communist parties in the 1948 elections. A year later this mandate was expanded to a broader range of activities known .sse as “covert” action. A new directive, titled NSC-10/2, instructed elements in the CIA t o u n d e r t ak e o p e r a t io n s “ w h i c h a r e c o n d u c t e d o r s p o n s o r e d b y t h i s G o v e r n m e n t ytisre a g a i n st h o st i l e f o r e ig n s t a te s o r g r o u p s o r i n su p p o rt o f f r ie n d l y f o r e i g n s t a t es or groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government responsi- bility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US them.”1 Thus was born Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for the notion that covert actions would be measures taken secretly that could be plau- sibly denied, even if used in conjunction with overt programs such as the Marshall Plan to bolster weak democratic institutions in postwar Europe. As Kennan himself described it, covert action should be “preventive direct action,” including sabotage, subversion against hostile states, assistance to resistance movements and guerril- elements.2 las, and support of indigenous anticommunist Although covert action was seen as essential to counter Moscow’s subversion, from the beginning it was controversial. First, there was concern about officially giving this responsibility to the CIA, which might prove to be too independent and expand such operations beyond what might be approved by the State Depart- ment or might undermine US foreign policy objectives. These objections were partly overcome by assigning Kennan himself to be the State Department’s first representative to the interagency oversight group—called the Senior Consultants to the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC)—that would review any CIA plans for action.3 A second concern was whether the CIA was the appropriate place for covert “paramilitary operations,” which the CIA initially questioned but Kennan seemed to insist on. Given the CIA’s origins in the OSS, the prospect of it conducting quasi- military operations might seem logical, but the OSS’s wartime performance had not been that impressive. Defense Department officials were not keen to have “cow- boys” operating outside its control. This issue has continued to be a source of fric- tion between the DOD and CIA over the years and will be touched on later in the chapter. However, other factors argued for assigning covert action to the CIA. First, the insistence on “plausible deniability” required secrecy, a capacity best suited to the new CIA. It could operate more quietly than either the State or Defense Departments; moreover, its budgets and programs were entirely cloaked in secrecy, unlike other national security operations. Second, a wide range of covert actions were best cen- tralized in one place, rather than distributed across different agencies depending on whether they were essentially political, economic, or military measures. Again, the CIA was the logical location. Third, the CIA was forging close liaison relationships with other intelligence services throughout the world. Thus, it was building a global overseas presence and had officers who ran agents, spoke the local languages, and were most aware of any counterintelligence threats. Finally, since the director of cen- .sse tral intelligence reported directly to the president, this would ensure that the com- ma n d e r i n c h ie f c o u ld b e fu l ly in c h a r g e o f a l l co v e r t o p e r a ti o n s . ytisre T h r o u g h o u t t h e e ar ly p h a s e s o f t h e C o l d W a r , p r e si d e n t s f r om Truman through Johnson utilized covert action extensively. According to one scholar, by 1952 there alone.4 Another declas- were more than forty covert action programs in Central Europe sified study reports that the CIA conducted over 80 operations during the Truman administration, over 100 during the Eisenhower years, approximately 160 during the brief Kennedy administration, and over 140 during Johnson’s term. While the scale and duration of those operations varied widely, it is nonetheless impressive that they hundreds.5 totaled in the WHAT FORMS DOES IT TAKE? Covert action is indeed an instrument of policy. Unlike the usual set of overt political, military, economic, or informational tools of statecraft, it is designed to remain secret. Simply stated, covert action encompasses all the instruments of statecraft when used covertly and run by the CIA under the auspices of the president. Hence, the range of covert action can be quite broad. Whether large or small, those operations can apply one or blend several of the usual tools of American statecraft. Some forms of covert actions might include the following: • Political: paying or pressuring foreign officials to take pro-US positions; sup- porting or influencing political parties, unions, or other interest groups; spon- soring pro- or antigovernment demonstrations; supporting coup plotting • Economic: providing funds to enable groups to undertake actions deemed favorable to the United States; conducting economic sabotage of foreign mili- tary or industrial production; disrupting a hostile government’s or organiza- tion’s financial transactions • Military: sponsoring pro-US factions within a foreign military; providing arms and training to rebels or governments favorable to the United States; fielding paramilitary groups fighting a US opponent; covertly weakening or destroy- ing an enemy’s military capabilities • Informational: conducting covert psychological warfare or propaganda; paying foreign journalists to promote favorable views of US policies; plac- ing media stories in foreign newspapers; sponsoring radio broadcasts into “denied” areas; conducting cyber operations against an adversary The early use of covert action in Western Europe in the late 1940s illustrates some of these forms of covert action. In 1947, as the threat of communist control of .sse Western European governments rose, the United States began secretly providing .6 I n a d d i - m o n e y t o s e le c t e d p ro d em o c ra c y g ro u p s i n s e v e r a l E u r o p e a n c o u n tr i e s ytisre tio n t o t h e w e ll - k n o w n T ru m a n D o c tr in e o f o p e n l y a i d i n g g o v e r n m e n t s o p p o s e d to communist subversion, the CIA sponsored so-called black propaganda in the form of widely distributed pamphlets that publicized the Red Army’s brutal tactics countries.7 Much of the during the war and the dismal conditions in communist-led focus was on the 1948 Italian elections. However, similar covert assistance was also provided to the Greek government by the CIA. Most of the above-mentioned forms of covert action were primarily responses to Soviet subversion. Yet the Truman administration also wished to take some cau- tiously proactive actions. For instance, the June 1948 Soviet-Yugoslav split (when Stalin expelled Yugoslavia from the Soviet-sponsored Comintern [Communist Inter- national] for its failure to defer to Moscow) opened an opportunity for the United States—through the CIA—to offer Belgrade secret aid to enhance its ability to with- attack.8 Subsequent decisions by the Truman administration stand a possible Soviet included not only overt trade assistance to Tito’s fragile economy but also secret CIA intelligence.9 Moreover, the NSC approved at least two liaison with Yugoslav military secret shipments of military equipment—orchestrated by CIA covert action director morale.10 More broadly, the Truman Frank Wisner—to bolster the Yugoslavian army’s administration wished to conduct psychological warfare against the Soviet Union by broadcasting news into Eastern Europe. For this purpose, the CIA sponsored the National Committee for a Free Europe, which set up Radio Free Europe (RFE), a ser- vice that broadcast news into Czechoslovakia beginning in 1950, and eventually a separate service, Radio Liberty (RL), that broadcast into the Soviet Union itself. The CIA secretly funded both RFE and RL until 1971, when its sponsorship was revealed and the function was transferred to the State Department as part of its overt public programs.11 diplomacy Covert action programs are sized to suit specific US political objectives, the feasi- bility and cost of covert action options, and the risk and damage that failure or dis- closure of such operations might hold for the United States. The least risky is the use of propaganda, which can range from “white” to “gray” to “black” operations (see box 9.1). Political action is usually taken when more rapid results are desired and the United States is prepared to run higher risks. The least-used but most controver- sial are paramilitary operations, which tend to be costly, lengthy, and hard to keep secret. Usually such paramilitary operations become known if not openly acknowl- edged by the United States. For example, by the early 1980s, it became impossible for the expanded scope of US support to the Afghan mujahideen fighters to be dis- guised; deniability was maintained in name only. The United States understood that the Soviets knew who was supplying US-manufactured Stinger antiaircraft missiles .sse Afghans.12 to the ytisre WHAT MAKES FOR SUCCESSFUL OR FAILED COVERT ACTION? Covert action has had a mixed reputation, at least in terms of what is known or believed by the public. In reality, most covert action operations remain unknown. From the hundreds (now probably thousands) of operations approved by presidents since 1945, only a small percentage have been publicly revealed or acknowledged. Of Box 9.1 Types of Covert Action Propaganda: Most often used form of covert action requiring few resources. Often takes longer to have impact, if only indirectly. Variants: • “White”: Usually advertised as being produced by a US government agency, such as the former US Information Agency; it is overt and usually truthful. Voice of America radio broadcasting is a good example of US efforts to provide truthful information. • “Gray”: Usually hides the fact of a US source, but sponsorship is often known by experts to be backed by the United States. The information is often accurate, if spun to a favorable view of the United States. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were initially examples of gray propaganda. • “Black”: Usually well-hidden sources that are providing disinformation designed to discredit an adversary or undermine an opponent. Forged documents are a classic form of black propaganda that alleges some horrific action by an adversary. For example, Soviet disinformation placed in Indian newspapers claimed the CIA had produced the AIDS virus. Political action: Used to directly influence a foreign government’s policies and actions; designed to have more immediate impact on decision-makers. For example, developing agents of influence who are able to work inside a foreign government or institution: • supporting media: buying or subsidizing newspapers or other foreign media for the purpose of developing inroads into foreign public opinion and government decisions • supporting civil society organizations: funding special-interest groups that are hostile to an anti-US regime; providing resources for their activities • supporting political parties: funding their officials and campaigns as well as pro- viding them with information, political expertise, or campaign supplies that are in short supply • influencing elections: supporting activities that can shift electoral support for or against particular candidates or parties through propaganda, demonstrations, or covert interference in electoral processes Economic: Covert use of economic tools (money, financial manipulation, or sabotage) to directly support groups working against a US adversary or alternatively to weaken it economically: vre • provision of money and other resources to political groups fighting against author- sth itarian governments • use of sabotage against the economic or industrial capacity of a foreign .sse government • manipulation of monetary and financial transactions of a hostile actor involving ytisre freezing bank funds or transfers vin Paramilitary: Unacknowledged military assistance or actual use of force to weaken or remove a hostile government or actor; least often employed as it usually requires more resources, has far more consequences, and is often hard to disguise the US role: • supplying of weapons, ammunition, and other matériel (e.g., radios, medical sup- plies) that can be readily used by a rebel group, often types that are not clearly of US manufacture course, the most publicized are those that fail or possibly involved wrongdoing. Some lessons can be drawn from some of the most infamous and celebrated cases: the 1953 coup in Iran, the 1961 Bay of Pigs operation, the 1986 Iran-Contra scandal, and the 1980–88 program to aid Afghans fighting the Soviets. The 1953 Coup in Iran: Lucky, Short-Term Success? The CIA helped to engineer the coup that put the shah back on the throne in Teh- ran. This operation has been responsible for much of the myth regarding the agency’s ability to topple governments. The facts show that in 1953, the CIA’s efforts in what was initially a British-backed effort to remove Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh almost failed. The prime minister’s nationalization of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and his increasing reliance on the Soviet-backed Tudeh Party had made him very unpopular in the West. The British and American governments were both convinced that he was becoming susceptible to Soviet influence, if not a communist himself. The British had removed their petroleum engineers, making it impossible for Iran to oper- ate its oil fields, and the Eisenhower government prevented international institutions from providing Iran with loans until Tehran reversed its decision on nationalization. These measures alone brought on a severe financial crisis in the country. British and American early plans to have the young Reza Shah remove Mosaddegh, however, were dashed when he fled to Paris, fearing the growing political instabil- .sse ity. For a time, the prospects of removing the prime minister seemed remote. How- e v e r , h i s g o v e rn m e n t w a s a lr e a d y h i g h l y u n p o p u l a r, h a v in g l o s t th e s u p p o rt o f t h e ytisre c le r i c s a n d th e m i li t a r y . H is in c r e a s i n g l y a u to c r a t ic b e h a v io r , s u c h a s h i s d e c i s i o n to dissolve the parliament, and his inability to control the streets were proving to be real liabilities, on which a second CIA covert operation (code name AJAX) was built. Through the secret funding and organization of antigovernment demonstrations and negative press articles, the CIA was able to convince the shah to return; thereafter, his loyal military removed Mosaddegh, and a more pliable prime minister was appointed. Kermit Roosevelt, one of the architects of this operation, remarked on what condi- tions need to be present: If “we are ever going to try something like this again, we want.”13 must be absolutely sure that people and the army want what we The Iranian coup—despite its primarily indigenous causes—became a model for subsequent efforts to use psychological and propaganda operations to force other anti-American leaders from office. The removal of Guatemalan leader Jacobo Árbenz in 1954 followed this pattern. Like Mosaddegh, Árbenz had shown a willingness to resist Washington, expropriate American companies, and toy with the idea of accept- ing aid from Moscow. Through the use of very modest amounts of money and people, the US operation (code-named PBSuccess) was able to fool Árbenz into thinking that a major counterrevolution was occurring. Using two planes, dropping a single large bomb on a large military parade ground, and issuing radio broadcasts reporting col- umns of soldiers marching to the capital, the CIA frightened Árbenz into resigning and seeking asylum at the Mexican embassy. Again, a small operation had led to surprising results. But, unfortunately, the lesson learned was that the CIA could easily pull off such coups without major costs. By one estimate, the Iran operation lasted less than six months, involved a handful of CIA dollars.14 At the time, the operation was judged a officers, and cost around a million huge success, and the shah’s strong support for US policies, including his anti-Soviet and pro-Israeli leanings, made his government a major pillar of US Middle East poli- cies. Less appreciated at the time was the prospect that installing the shah by stealth would make the United States the “Great Satan” to many Iranians who would later resent the shah’s Westernization plans and his vicious security service, SAVAK. The 1953 coup has remained a key element of the grievances and strong anti-American attitudes of the post-1979 governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Likewise, top- pling the Árbenz government was a relatively minor paramilitary operation, but it too did not lead to better governance but rather decades of repressive authoritarian rule, albeit one that was more anticommunist in tone. The 1961 Bay of Pigs Fiasco: Wishful Thinking The story behind the Bay of Pigs highlights the dangers of inadequate—but not non- .sse existent—oversight by the president of covert operations for which he will be held r e s p o n s ib l e . T h e 1 9 5 9 C u b an R e v o lu t io n o u st e d t h e r e v i l e d d ic ta to r P r e s i d e n t F u l- ytisre g e n c i o B a t i s t a i n f av o r o f th e y o u n g , c h ar i s m a t ic r e v o l u t i o n a r y F id e l C a s t r o . R i s in g animosity between the Castro government and the Eisenhower administration caused Havana to embrace Moscow’s patronage by 1960. At that point President Eisenhower asked CIA director Allen Dulles for a covert action plan to bring down the Castro regime. Near the end of his term, a few senior CIA officials had developed an elaborate paramilitary plan (code-named Operation Zapata) to place fifteen hundred trained  and armed exiles onto the island, who would be the vanguard to an expected massuprising against the supposedly unpopular Castro. President Kennedy insisted that the US role remain invisible and would not approve sufficient air support to the beach necessary.15 Dulles and his head of landing that some military advisers believed was covert operations, Richard Bissell, downplayed this requirement in conversations with President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and believed that the president would be forced to authorize more overt force if the invasion started to go badly. It did go badly almost immediately, but Kennedy would not approve more than one hour’s sortie of six bombers, which could not turn the tide. Thus, the exiles soon found themselves on an inhospitable beachhead (known as the Bay of Pigs). The few unmarked aircraft allowed to bomb the Cuban airfields were not successful in destroying the Cuban air force jets that would quickly attack the beach landings. Cuban ground forces numbering nearly twenty thousand and armed with tanks easily defeated and killed or captured the exiles. As postmortems would testify, the covert action plan suffered from wishful thinking that Castro was unpopu- lar and that a general uprising would spontaneously occur; moreover, the operation itself was not a secret, as Latin American newspapers had been reporting the training of an exile force that would mount an invasion. Finally, the strict compartmentaliza- tion of the operation inside the CIA had prevented any true country experts from questioning the operational assumptions and details. In the end, however, President Kennedy admitted it was his mistake to depend so heavily on a few senior CIA offi- cers who were so committed to the operation that they could not be objective about its chances for success. The abject failure of this operation convinced President Kennedy that he needed much more oversight of future operations. He did not give up on anti-Castro covert action, but he did deputize his brother to oversee future plans to ensure no new fail- ures. Much has been written about other, more multifaceted CIA plans to remove Cas- tro (under what became known as Operation Mongoose). While that program focused on economic sabotage, it did include assassination plots—none of which were ever executed.16 The 1986 Iran-Contra Operation: The NSC Goes Rogue .sse The Iran-Contra affair arose out of the Reagan administration’s simultaneous efforts t o f r e e h o s t a g e s h e l d by Ir a n - b a ck e d H e zb o l la h in 1 9 8 5 w h i le r u n n in g a m a j o r p a ra - ytisre m i l it a r y o p e r a t io n i n C e n t ra l A m e ri c a . In b o t h c a s e s , th e a d m i n is t ra ti o n fa c e d s o m e political and legal impediments. In the first case, it was US policy not to negoti- ate with terrorists for hostages. At the time, Hezbollah held seven Americans in Lebanon, and President Reagan was eager to get them back. In the second case, the Reagan administration had been running a CIA-backed paramilitary operation that was no longer popular with Congress and sought ways to circumvent legislative  restrictions.President Reagan earlier had approved a covert action plan for the CIA to fund anti- Sandinista rebels (the “Contras”) to harass the Nicaraguan government, which was seen as a pro-Cuban foothold in Central America. Following some missteps by the CIA (including the illegal mining of harbors in Nicaragua), Congress had steadily limited the agency’s backing of the Contras by allowing only nonlethal aid, then putting fund- ing limits on the aid and eventually banning it entirely in 1985 through the Boland Amendment. US Marine Corps lieutenant colonel Oliver North, assigned to the NSC, was put in charge of finding new ways to fund the Contras. He succeeded in soliciting monies from “third countries” (largely from the Middle East) but soon began funnel- ing the profits from the sale of arms to Iran to aid the Contras—both actions that would later been seen as circumventing congressional intent if not the law. Unbeknown to most CIA officials as well as large parts of the US national security bureaucracy, North concocted this elaborate illegal covert plan (called “the Enter- prise”) with CIA director William Casey and a few others. Senior CIA officers, includ- ing its then deputy director, opposed CIA involvement in the plan. In essence, the NSC now was running a covert action program. North along with the then national security adviser, Vice Adm. John Poindexter, were largely responsible for planning and running the operation, enlisting individual officers from the NSA and CIA for logistical support as needed. Most significantly, the operation was conducted with- out any clear presidential approval. Poindexter later admitted a presidential directive was approved only retroactively, which included the proviso that the CIA not inform it.17 Following lengthy congressional and Congress, but Reagan never actually signed a special prosecutor’s investigations, North, Poindexter, and other NSC, military, and CIA officers were indicted on a range of charges including obstruction of justice, destroying evidence, and lying to or withholding evidence from Congress. Many were later pardoned by President George H. W. Bush. This scandal highlighted the need for more executive and legislative control over covert action. In addition, President Reagan empowered a special presidential review board (named the Tower Commission after its chairman, Sen. John Tower) to investi- gate how the NSC found itself at the center of this failed operation. The Tower Com- mission’s recommendations also became instrumental in reforming the role of the .sse NSC system that Reagan’s successor, George H. W. Bush, established. As some former o ffi c i al s n o t e d a t t h e t im e , “ t h e r ep o rt r e a c he d i m p o r ta n t c on c l u s i o n s th a t t he co v e rt ytisre ac ti o n o n t h e s a l e o f a r m s t o I ra n d id n o t c o m p ly wi th U .S . l a w p r i o r t o a w r it t e n fi n d in g . The executive branch did not comply with legal requirements that Congress be noti- manner.”18 In other respects it let the Reagan admin- fied of covert actions in a ‘timely’ istration off gently by suggesting Iran-Contra was an “aberration.” That said, it was clear that the NSC system under Reagan—which saw a revolving door of six national security advisers in eight years—had proven to be one of the least well managed. 1980−88 Afghanistan: Successful but Hardly Covert As one participant termed it, the Reagan plan to reverse the 1979 Soviet invasion of War.19 Initi- Afghanistan proved to be the largest and last covert action of the Cold ated by President Carter, what President Reagan inherited was a very small operation. Designed to merely “harass” the Soviets, not defeat them, it amounted to a few mil- lion dollars to purchase bolt-action Lee-Enfield rifles and transfer them via Pakistan to anti-Soviet mujahideen. Upon taking office, however, President Reagan and his advisers determined they were prepared to expand their objectives to inflict heavy Soviets.20 The program grew from $120 million in political and military costs on the 1981 to over $700 million in 1988, when the program ended by successfully pushing Afghanistan.21 What began as the procurement of a few rifles the Red Army out of and mortars became a massive transfer of sophisticated weapons and ammunition to support 120,000 mujahideen. The end result was the death of thousands of Rus- sian soldiers, a major headache for the Kremlin at home, and the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1988. One important feature of this successful operation was the strong congressional support it had elicited from the beginning. Indeed, a few propo- nents, such as Congressman Charlie Wilson, became well known publicly and closely Kremlin.22 associated with this supposedly secret war against the One by-product of this success, however, was greater difficulty in maintaining any plausible deniability. At the height of the program, the Afghan task force of CIA officers numbered over a hundred. The program had initially relied mostly on Egyptian- and Chinese-manufactured weaponry. However, the Soviet introduction of heavily armed M-24 Hind helicopters had made the arduous transport of weapons through moun- tain passes costly. After some deliberation, the CIA elected to arm the mujahideen with advanced, US-manufactured, shoulder-fired Stinger surface-to-air missiles. These weapons proved effective in pushing Soviet helicopters beyond the range of their own weapons, so they were unable to staunch the resupply of Afghan fighters from Paki- stan. The problem, of course, was that the sophistication of these weapons undermined the already thin veneer of plausible deniability with which the program had begun. By the late 1980s, however, the Reagan administration was less concerned about US .sse sponsorship remaining secret and more convinced that such a forceful covert action program had dealt the Soviets a serious setback that should be trumpeted. ytisre LESSONS THAT SHOULD BE LEARNED Decades and hundreds of operations later, there are clear lessons that one can learn from the successes and failures of presidentially directed covert action. First, covert action should never be either the “first or last resort.” That means covert action is best conducted as part of a comprehensive set of policy actions, of which it is only one small piece. It is not a replacement for good statecraft and overt diplomacy, nor can it substitute for the absence of any other good options. The adage of covert action being a “third option” between doing nothing or going to war misrepresents the kind of leverage it can realistically produce. Second, as a rule covert action is most effective when it remains small and discreet. The use of propaganda and some modest political action can help to reinforce overt US political, economic, and military actions. With covert action kept modest and secret, the chances it will be disclosed and possibly discredit American foreign policies remain low. Also, setting modest objectives with limited resources increases the prospects of its success. Third, covert action works best if it has bipartisan congressional support. If that is lacking, there may be good reasons why a president should rethink the feasibility or value of an operation. Where there is serious congressional opposition, there may be a deeper foreign policy disagreement than simply the use of covert action. Significant opposition in Congress or perhaps even within the national security enterprise also increases the risks of whistleblower leaks to the media that can defeat such programs. Fourth, good covert action requires good intelligence and rigorous analysis. A poor understanding of the geopolitical context in which an operation is to be conducted is a recipe for failure. Moreover, optimistic appraisals by committed proponents of an operation should be tested by other experts both inside the CIA and by national security officials with no stake in the game. Last and most important, covert action proposals need to balance their ethical and legal aspects against the purported political benefits of such operations. There needs to be proportionality in how much the United States will risk in terms of its moral and political standing in the world against the short-term gains a covert action program might produce. In many cases, the unintended consequences of success may well carry greater costs than those near-term benefits. Like the overt use of military force, however, covert action should be directed only against serious external threats for the purpose of protecting the United States and its institutions as well as its people. Thus, some practitioners, such as former senior British intelligence official Sir David .sse Omand, have suggested applying a set of principles—“just intelligence” (jus intelli- )— t h a t m ir r o r s t h e ju s t w a r d o c tr i n e applied to the use of lethal military force. g e n t ia ytisre A c c o rd in g l y , t ho s e p r i n c i p le s w o u l d i n v o l v e • a sufficient and enduring cause (significant threat or opportunity), • an integrity of motive (US actions are legitimate and moral), • proportionate methods (US actions are reasonable and limited in effect), • a legitimate authority (presidential authorization and congressional notification), • a reasonable prospect of success (US actions are well conceived/planned), and • reliance as a last resort (other options have been judged insufficient and require methods).23 such additional If these principles were applied to covert action decisions, a president would have to weigh the nature of a threat, the legitimacy and morality of a US covert operation, its chances of success, and its likely longer-term consequences, as well as whether other less risky options might achieve similar or better results. HOW HAS COVERT ACTION BEEN MANAGED? For the first three decades of the CIA’s existence, covert action was conducted with few formal restrictions or regulations and uneven oversight. Presidents from Truman to Carter varied in the degree to which they wished to oversee the CIA’s covert action programs, although each established an NSC committee to oversee and provide advice on covert action programs. Those committees took a variety of names, often carrying cryptic titles (e.g., “Special Coordination Group” under Eisenhower, “Special Group” under Kennedy) or were given numbers (e.g., “40 Committee” under Nixon/ Johnson).24 Those NSC groups typically included CIA Ford, “303 Committee” under covert action managers plus representatives from the State and Defense Depart- ments, along with an NSC staff member representing the president. It was common for presidents to issue NSC decision documents authorizing the CIA to conduct covert actions aimed at some general political objectives without nec- essarily reviewing all the details of the plans. Naturally, for large and highly risky or sensitive operations, such as the 1953 Iran coup and the 1962 Bay of Pigs operation, presidents took a more prominent role. Partly presidents distanced themselves from the operational details in order to preserve plausible deniability. In fact, for many of the smaller, less controversial covert programs, the CIA director could essentially authorize them without formal presidential approval, so long as the NSC oversight committee considered them to be consistent with American foreign policy objectives. In some administrations, operations that involved costs under $25,000 and were pre- .sse sumed to be less risky were left to the CIA director’s discretion.

U p t o t h e n , s u b c o m m it - tees of the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of both houses signed off on CIA budget authorization and appropriations, including covert action pro- grams. In the early days, Congress was especially wary of knowing too much about covert action. The Armed Service and Appropriations Subcommittees were mainly concerned about the CIA having sufficient resources to fight communism, and less interested in overseeing its operations. The few congressional initiatives to estab- lish real oversight in the 1950s and 1960s—such as calls to create a joint oversight committee—never garnered much support. For the most part, oversight consisted of private, informal conversations between the CIA director and individual powerful much.25 committee chairmen, who typically did not wish to know too CURRENT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT A series of events and revelations led to what is today’s congressional oversight of intelligence activities, especially covert action. First, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Congress determined that President Nixon had conducted secret wars in Laos and Cambodia without informing Congress, partly through the use of CIA covert action capabilities. So, in 1974, Congress passed the Hughes-Ryan Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, which compelled the president to approve a finding for each covert action program and required that those findings be “notified” to the select members of the armed services and appropriations committees prior to the operation. This measure did not give Congress a veto on any program, but it did prevent future presidents from denying their involvement should an operation be exposed. Subsequent legislation in 1980 (the Intelligence Oversight Act) strength- ened the original Hughes-Ryan Amendment’s insistence on “advance” notification to demand “timely” notification. Second, the Watergate hearings that revealed significant ill-advised and in some cases illegal activities by the CIA, NSA, and FBI against anti–Vietnam War activists led in 1975 to the hearings of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmen- tal Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. Among other things, this so- called Church Committee (named after its chairman, Sen. Frank Church) explored CIA covert action programs extensively. It criticized presidents for not ruling out some of the more extreme plans, such as the one to assassinate Fidel Castro. Senator Church famously warned during the hearings that the CIA was a “rogue elephant,” yet the final conclusions of the year-long investigations essentially disproved the alle- gation that the CIA had conducted covert operations without presidential approval. .sse Although some of the operations may have been misguided, poorly implemented, o r il le g a l , it b ec a m e c l e a r th a t a ll h a d t h e b l es s in g o f P r es id e n t N ix o n o r P r e s id e n t ytisre Jo h n s o n .

The third event was the Iran-Contra scandal of 1986, which moved congressional oversight of covert action to an even higher level. As Congress became less and less enthusiastic for the funding of the Contras’ war against communists in Nicaragua, it passed key legislation that added new requirements on presidential notifications of major covert action programs to the oversight committees. In particular, the 1988 and 1991 intelligence legislation insisted the president notify congressional com- mittees within forty-eight hours, that there be a written finding signed by the presi- dent, that it not be issued retroactively (as occurred in the Iran-Contra case), and that the president list all involved US government agencies (such as the Depart- ment of State or Department of Defense) as well as any foreign entities. Most of these new restrictions were aimed at heading off another circumvention of congres- affair.26 sional intent as occurred in the Iran-Contra As a practical matter, congressional notification of covert action findings does not prevent the president from going forward. However, it does impose a degree of disci- pline on what an administration attempts to do covertly, when it runs the risk of con- gressional condemnation. At worst, the oversight committees might refuse funding in the next year’s appropriations for a covert action program they did not support or put strict funding or operational limits on a program. On the positive side, a president benefits from having congressional assent to its covert action programs, particularly if they prove to be controversial or possibly fail; in such circumstances, the White House can at least spread responsibility down Pennsylvania Avenue. And finally, out- side critiques can in some instances head off ill-advised proposals or warn a president of political controversy a program could entail that had not been raised by Executive Branch advisers. CURRENT PROCEDURES FOR APPROVING COVERT ACTION In the post-1990 period, covert action programs have been reviewed and approved using the long-established interagency process described in earlier chapters. Like other policy decisions, a covert action proposal will often emerge from the White House or other NSC discussions. Most administrations produce a classified national security directive outlining the interagency process by which it planned to propose, review, and approve covert action. While each administration since 1990 has modi- fied that process in some ways, each has had a much more deliberate process that .sse ensures covert actions are rigorously reviewed internally by the CIA as well as by the N S C , f u l l y b r i e fe d t o a n d d u l y a u t h o r iz e d b y t h e president, and, finally, notified to the ytisre ap p ro p r i a t e c o n g r e s s io n a l o v e rs i g h t a u t h o r i t i e s. As an illustration of this elaborate vetting process, the following describes how tenure.27 At the request of covert action was handled during George W. Bush’s President Bush, the national security adviser would typically draft a memo to the CIA director (and after 2005, the director of national intelligence). Almost without exception, no CIA planning would begin without NSC authorization. Then, the CIA’s Box 9.2 Typical Covert Action Authorization Process Directorate of Operations would assign the appropriate regional or functional oper- ations division (or, after 2015, the appropriate mission center) to prepare proposals (see box 9.2). For instance, it would be natural that any covert action dealing with a Middle Eastern country would be developed within the CIA’s regional mission cen- ter covering Middle Eastern countries or that a counterterrorist covert action would emanate from the Mission Center for Counterterrorism. In virtually all cases, lawyers are extensively involved in planning and overseeing covert operations to ensure they are conducted within the bounds of the intelligence community’s standing regulations, executive orders, and US law. The CIA’s Office of General Counsel will have to sign off on any proposals before they are reviewed by the NSC’s legal counsel as well as by the interagency NSC Lawyers Group (LG), chaired by the NSC’s legal counsel and including lawyers from the Department of State, Department of Defense, and Department of Justice. The LG also participates in the interagency annual review of every ongoing covert action program. Based on this review, the president would then send a report to the congressional intelligence oversight committees that indicated which programs would be continued, modified, or terminated in the coming year. This elaborate pro- cess, if anything, dispels the notion that the CIA can independently launch secret operations without the knowledge or approval of the president and his senior policy .sse advisers.

The CIA might present a set of options or make a recommendation on the most promising one that it believes meets the president’s objective. Once the covert action proposal has met with the approval of the Directorate of Operations, a cross- directorate review group reporting to the CIA director (i.e., the Covert Action Review Group) would review, amend, or approve the proposal. If the CIA director approves review.28 the plan, it would be forwarded to the White House for interagency At the White House, the NSC’s senior director for intelligence (typically a CIA officer assigned to the NSC) would chair a special interagency policy committee that reviews covert action plans. Attendance would be limited to the specially cleared rep- resentatives from the State Department, the Defense Department, and the Joint Staff, representatives.29 The White House contingent would typically along with the LG include NSC senior directors responsible for the region or focus of the covert action, a senior representative of the vice president’s office, the NSC’s legal counsel, and a senior deputy from the Office of Management and Budget. On occasion, a Treasury representative might be included if the covert action involves financial transactions. The IPC would focus on the obvious questions about a program’s costs, benefits, risks, chances of success, and legality. The State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research would also be attuned to how the covert action would fit with and impact existing diplomatic policies and how ambassadors in the region of the opera- tion might react or be affected. It might take several meetings and drafts of a potential finding before it is ready to be transmitted to the Deputies Committee and eventu- ally the Principals Committee for approval and signature by the president. By law, once the president has signed a finding, it has to be transmitted to the congressional oversight committees. That is usually accomplished within forty-eight hours unless there are special circumstances. In highly sensitive and fragile operations, such noti- fication can also be limited to the so-called Gang of Eight—the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate, as well as the majority and minority leaders of the committees.30 two intelligence oversight .sse KEY COVERT ACTION ISSUES IN A POST 9/11 ERA ytisre The 9/11 attacks have once again elevated covert action to an important instrument of national security policy. One measure of this is the huge increases in the CIA’s budget that are partly explained by the use of covert action applied to the global war against terrorism across multiple presidential administrations in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Those operations depended much more on new forms of covert action, including renditions, interrogations, and armed drone operations. The earlier question of where paramilitary operations rightfully belong—at the CIA or the DOD—has also risen again. And there is now the rising concern about foreign intelli- gence services employing cyber operations not only for espionage purposes but also for covert information operations against the United States and other democracies. Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation In the wake of the 9/11 tragedy and the fear of follow-on attacks, President George W. Bush authorized the CIA to conduct covert action not just to disrupt terrorism plots but also to detain and interrogate alleged al-Qaeda members, who might have plots.31 These covert activities amounted to a sensi- information regarding any future tive collection operation that did not fit neatly under the definition and interagency review procedures for covert actions. Those authorities, which the DOJ approved at the time, included secret renditions from theaters of combat and harsh interrogations at undisclosed overseas locations. Slightly more than a hundred detainees were cap- tured on the battlefield, held at these sites, and interrogated. President Bush publicly acknowledged the program of detention and transfer of some detainees to Guanta- namo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, on September 6, 2006. As described by former CIA director Michael Hayden, enhanced interrogation (EITs)—including sleep deprivation, stress positions, body slaps, water techniques dousing, and in a few cases “waterboarding”—were used on about one-third of the detainees. Director Hayden claims that roughly half of what the CIA knew about detainees.32 Other officials—including President Obama’s first al-Qaeda came from DNI, retired admiral Dennis Blair—were less convinced that EITs were effective, ethical.33 Obama’s first CIA director, Leon Panetta, also had testified at legal, or his nomination hearing that he believed waterboarding constituted torture, and President Obama issued an executive order shortly after taking office that limited interrogation techniques to those found in the then existing army field manual on waterboarding.34 interrogation, and he specifically prohibited The interrogation program’s effectiveness and appropriateness remains a debat- able proposition. An extensive six-thousand-page Senate Select Committee on Intelli- .sse gence review of the interrogation program—including a declassified six-hundred-page s u m m a ry — c l a im e d th a t t h e C I A ’ s p r o g r a m w a s d e e p ly fl a w e d .

Asked by President Bush shortly after the brutal airliner attacks in 2001, the CIA took action to use whatever means necessary to ensure that other plots were not about to unfold. The CIA has acknowledged that the initial phase of the interro- gation program was not well managed; its revelation in the press has also caused the CIA to lose credibility and possibly the support of other intelligence partners who had agreed to host “secret prisons” where some of the EITs were conducted. Over- all, a president’s sense of urgency overrode caution about whether a program could be both effective and ethical. And, not surprisingly, journalists began reporting that there had been concerns that the CIA would once again be “scapegoated” once the shifted.37 political winds Early in his term, President Donald Trump had hinted that he might consider restoring some of the harsher interrogation techniques, but his then secretary of defense, James Mattis, said he did not believe they were necessary or effective. Other former intelligence officials, including Michael Hayden, have stated that any reintro- duction of waterboarding would force military officers to refuse an “illegal order,” as prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So far, there has not been any sign of the Trump administration returning to such covert collection operations. Drones and Targeted Killings A second new dimension to post-9/11 covert action has been the advent of armed unmanned aerial vehicles—commonly called drones. Since the Balkan crises of the 1990s, the CIA has operated UAVs for intelligence-collection purposes—for example, surveillance of battlefields and tracking military movements. Those surveillance pro- grams have become a standard part of the CIA’s mission for identifying and track- ing suspected terrorists and other battlefield combatants. Following the al-Qaeda attacks on the US embassies in Africa and the USS Cole, the Bill Clinton White House urgently pressed to begin arming some UAVs for possible covert action operations. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, high-level discussions between the White House, the Pentagon, and the CIA focused on the merits of arming the current Predator UAV for the purpose of targeting Osama bin Laden. As former CIA director George Tenet described those decisions in the late 1990s, “the National Security Council autho- rized us [CIA] to begin deploying the Predator by September 1, in either an armed or .sse unarmed reconnaissance mode. . . . We preferred that the next time it was over Afghan- A l th o u g h i s t a n t h a t i t b e e q u ip p e d to t ak e im m e d i a t e a c ti o n if w e s p o t t e d U B L . ” ytisre t a r g e t e d k i l l i n g s h a d l o n g b e e n t h e pr ac t i c e b y th e U S a ll y I s r a e l , it c o n s t i t u te d a n e w policy for the United States. Following the 9/11 attacks, any hesitation about arming the Predator evaporated. Drone attacks began in earnest during the Bush administration. The US Air Force conducted those battlefield operations in Afghanistan, but of course it relied exten- sively on intelligence provided by the CIA and other agencies. When President Obama took office, he markedly increased drone strikes, which some observers believed were designed to shift from a boots-on-the-ground strategy toward a counterterrorism strat- egy. At the same time as drone strikes were escalating, outside observers believed that collateral damage caused by them was also rising. Several reports claimed that the 900.39 Later, CIA direc- civilian casualties might be as low as 250 or as high as 400 to tor Brennan publicly defended the Agency’s claims that there had been no civilian deaths caused by any classified drone programs, because President Obama instituted strike.40 a much more rigorous process that called for near certainty before approving a Skeptics remain unconvinced regarding a nearly perfect record of drone strikes, and the debate over whether drones attacks are effective continues. Proponents argue they are far more precise and less risky to the US military than aerial bombing raids or ground operations; moreover, drone attacks are also less visible. Opponents argue that drone strikes create a moral hazard of encouraging more attacks on less important tar- gets because they pose no major risk to US personnel. They also believe that collateral damage is higher than the US government is willing to acknowledge and that civilian deaths result in increased recruitment to terrorist organizations. According to press reports, the Obama administration eventually reduced drone strikes, partly due to its successful elimination of key targets. In July 2016, President Obama also moved to quell allegations of substantial civilian casualties by issuing an executive order that required agencies to develop more precise rules of engagement selection.41 This was accompanied by an annual report from the DNI on and target the number of strikes in areas outside active hostilities, the number of combatant and noncombatant casualties, and the reasons for any discrepancies between noncomba- tant drone casualty estimates by nongovernmental organizations and the US govern- ment. In 2018, there had also been some hints that the Trump administration might be considering shifting such drone operations to Afghanistan. In any case, US use of armed drones and targeted killings has set a precedent that other countries may eventually use to justify their own lethal drone operations. Even now, there are report- edly cases of Syrian opposition forces attempting to attack the main Russian military drones.42 bases there through armed Paramilitary Operations: CIA or DOD? .sse T h e w a r s i n A f g h a n is t a n an d I r a q h a v e r e v i v e d a l o n g -s t a n d in g q ue s t i o n o f w h e t h e r ytisre th e U S m i l it a r y or th e C I A s h o u l d b e p r i n c i p a ll y r e sp o n s i b le f o r m a j o r p a r a m il i t ar y operations. When 9/11 occurred, the CIA was ready with a plan to insert CIA officers into Afghanistan to work with the Northern Alliance to build a military campaign against the Taliban. The CIA had the foreign intelligence as well as an intelligence network in Afghanistan and could operate covertly and quickly to put this in place. Yet Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was not comfortable with the CIA leading the operation and insisted there be some agreement about how the CIA’s covert action role and the United States Central Command’s operations would be coordi- nated. There was a memorandum of understanding that laid out the terms of the two organizations’ operating areas and responsibilities, including a commitment to col- operations.43 laborate as well as deconflict their While this division of effort seemed to work in Afghanistan, it never fully settled the issue. Periodically there have been efforts by the DOD to gain more control over paramilitary activities. In 1995, when former deputy secretary of defense John Deutch became DCI and CIA director, he tried unsuccessfully to allow more military control over CIA operations. His assistant DCI for military support, Adm. Dennis Blair (later DNI under President Obama) also believed the military should be running any covert operations.44 However, their efforts failed to gain much White House paramilitary or congressional support. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Pentagon officials and advisers believed the department needed to get more involved in the covert side of the war on terrorism, recommending large increases in special operations forces and missions.45 Defense Secretary Rumsfeld tried to expand military operations expanded to include measures that smacked of covert political-influence operations as well as Congress.46 covert HUMINT operations that had not been approved by The reality is that the CIA and DOD seem to be conducting similar activities with many of the same goals and results but under very different authorities. CIA opera- tions are covered under Title 50 of the United States Code. Among other aspects of war, it specifies that any covert actions—as distinguished from its intelligence- collection mission—be approved by the president in a written finding and notified to the congressional oversight committees. Such covert actions are conducted with the expectation that the United States will deny official responsibility and that CIA personnel have none of the legal protections that uniformed military officers would normally have. Under Title 10 of the United States Code, traditional military activities include kinetic (lethal) action in the form of unconventional warfare and special operations necessary in preparation of the battlefield environment. DOD special operations thus fall under these statutes. In most instances, however, military personnel are in uni- .sse form, are protected by the Geneva Accords if captured, and must follow the rules of w a r .

Most important, the United States Special Operations Command is not under any obligation to prenotify Congress of these special operations. Figure 9.1 illustrates the different chains of command used in Title 10 and Title 50. The May 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden has considerably blurred the above distinction. CIA director Leon Panetta announced the successful operation as being conducted under Title 50 authorities, in which he had overall responsibility for the covert action. At the same time, he and President Obama acknowledged that spe- cial operations forces, under the command of Vice Adm. William McRaven, had con- ducted the covert strike action. A number of national security legal specialists had noted that the modern battlefield has led to a greater synthesis of intelligence and military operations than ever before, blurring any clear lines between the two func- tions: “As a matter of law, the President may authorize any agency to conduct a covert action via presidential finding. Alternatively, the President must justify the use of force under traditional military activities under doctrines in domestic jus ad bellum law.”47 and international Another example of blurred lines has been the paramilitary activities conducted in the Syrian conflict. In 2013, President Obama was reluctant to intervene in what many .sse believed to be a messy civil war, choosing instead to encourage regional states such as T u r k e y a n d S a u d i A ra b i a t o t a k e a l a r g e r ro l e i n su p p o r tin g t h e o p p o s i ti o n t o S y r ia n ytisre pr e s i d e n t B a s h a r a l-A s s a d . O b s e r v e r s b e li e v e d t h a t O b a m a w a s t r y i n g t o e n d t h e I r a q conflict, not get the US military involved in neighboring Syria. As recounted in several memoirs by former senior Obama advisers, they were urging the president to sup- port opposition groups in Syria openly as well as covertly. Part of the explanation for multiple programs lay in the changing nature of the conflict. Once ISIS had become a bigger threat to Iraq, the Obama administration was obliged to adopt an overt military effort to defeat it rather than rely solely on other covert means of pressuring Assad to relinquish power. The Pentagon’s program was designed to bolster Iraqi forces fight- ing ISIS rather than strengthen Syrian opposition forces. But having simultaneous and ultimately unsuccessful programs running within the same country, under very different authorities, merely highlights the unclear lines separating military and intel- ligence operations (under Title 10 and Title 50, respectively). If future presidents consider more joint military-intelligence operations, then those distinctions may become less and less clear, and perhaps there will need to be new executive orders or legislation that create a new category of covert joint military- intelligence operations. Without it, there will be concerns that DOD clan- destine operations might suffer from a lack of presidential and congressional over- sight of special military activities. Shortly after taking office, President Trump gave Secretary of Defense Mattis wider authority for conducting military operations against terrorism, after the Obama administration had been accused of overly cau- “micro-management.”48 Since then, several special operations have suffered tious some notable casualties, including a US Navy SEAL lost in a botched operation in Yemen and four US Army Special Forces troops ambushed in Niger in 2017. The loss of the personnel in Niger has raised new concerns about the preparedness of the DOD to conduct such special activities, which had not been previously approved at the highest levels in the executive branch or by congressional oversight committees. President Trump reacted to that event by noting he had given his generals more lee- mission.49 Congressional investigations way and had not specifically authorized this into these events may well lead to more debate over whether the DOD or the CIA is best suited for covert paramilitary activities or whether some better mix of those organizations’ capabilities should be found. Future Covert Action: Cyber Operations Covert action in the future will also increasingly involve cyberspace. Although unac- knowledged, it is likely that recent US presidents have already authorized some covert operations designed to attack adversaries’ information systems and the mili- tary programs run by them. The IC has long had the intelligence-collection mis- .sse sion of penetrating and exploiting adversaries’ critical information systems. That c o l le ct i o n m i s s i o n h a s p u t t h e C I A a n d o t h e r i n te l l i g e n c e a g e n c ie s s u c h a s t h e N S A ytisre in a p o s i ti o n t o g o f u r t h e r , if d ir e c t e d , t o c o n d u c t o p e r a t i o n s t h a t c o u ld d i s r u p t o r destroy an enemy’s military capabilities. Naturally, the DOD is also involved in cyber operations. In the past few years, senior defense officials have acknowledged that the United States is prepared not just to conduct defensive cyber operations to pro- tect military information systems but also to consider conducting offensive cyber operations.50 Little is known, correctly so, about the nature and extent of US covert cyber operations. United States Cyber Command is responsible for shielding DOD infor- mation systems from attacks and for conducting military cyber operations. At the moment, however, the four-star officer leading the NSA is also responsible for run- ning CYBERCOM. The current arrangement where a single senior military officer is dual hatted, running a major intelligence organization as well as a separate military command, further blurs the lines between intelligence and military operations. The Obama administration had considered separating the two responsibilities, and that might still occur in the future. The CIA, on the other hand, has been involved in so-called information operations as part of its own intelligence mission. It established a Directorate of Digital Innova- tion as part of a 2015 modernization of the agency’s organizational structure. That directorate collects cyber-related intelligence as well as manages the increasingly data.”51 At the same time, the CIA may well be called important exploitation of “big on to develop covert actions that involve the use of cyber operations. Some press reporting has indicated that small cyber operations may have been launched against members.52 the personal computers of key al-Qaeda Given the growing importance of cyberspace to most governments’ civilian sectors and military programs, it seems inevitable that cyber operations will be a significant new form of covert action. Where once the United States focused on eco- nomic or military “sabotage” or “political influence” conducted through newspaper placements and black broadcasting, now there can be cyber options. This has been amply demonstrated by the North Korean cyber operation against Sony Pictures in 2014, which penetrated the American entertainment company’s computer sys- tem, published its emails, and also destroyed some data. The 2010 attack on Iran’s nuclear program has also been analyzed by private security firms to be so sophis- ticated that it was more likely conducted by a government than any individual or hacker group. Likewise, the 2019 DNI’s Worldwide Threat Assessment identified Beijing as posing a persistent cyber threat to the United States’ military and critical systems.53 infrastructure The Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential campaign has become an .sse example of how covert use of cyberspace to penetrate electoral computer systems and to m a n i p u la te so ci a l m e d ia w e b s i te s t o p r o d u c e b o g u s n e w s s to r i e s ca n in fl u e n c e v o t er s . ytisre A jo in t N S A -C IA - F B I- D N I a s s e s sm e n t c h ar a c te r iz e d th e R u s s i a n p o li ti ca l -i n fl u e n c e campaign as an officially sanctioned and highly organized effort to use covert cyber operations, along with overt Russian media, third parties, and social media bloggers, to Trump’s.54 Other examples undermine the Hillary Clinton campaign in favor of Donald are likely to emerge over time, suggesting that this will be a potential tool for the United States as well as its adversaries. To summarize, then, covert action is likely to remain a potent tool for future presi- dents but also one that contains a number of operational, political, and legal-ethical risks. As former official Gregory Treverton’s comments at the beginning of this chapter note, Americans do not want to think of their government as conducting dirty tricks, but the fact that governments hostile to the United States will do so tempts any presi- dent or senior US official to reply in kind. Adopting a set of principles such as cited by Sir David Omand earlier in this chapter would be one way to ensure that covert actions remain within the bounds of what would be acceptable to the American people.

The US military had more elaborate plans for the invasion of Cuba and believed noth- ing short of a major operation would dislodge Castro. However, it was content to let the CIA continue its plans, believing in the end that Kennedy would have to provide more military support and thereby be open to its more overt plans for invasion. This was an important back- drop to the military’s thinking that invasion was necessary during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 16. Daugherty, Secrets, 154. Executive 17. Treverton, Action, 226. Covert 18.

Devine, Hunting, 25–42, provides an eyewitness account of the operation by the Good former Afghan task force chief of the covert action program against the Soviet occupation. 20. On March 27, 1985, “National Security Decision Directive 166: U.S. Policy, Programs, and Strategy in Afghanistan” stipulated that “our covert program will deny Afghanistan to the Soviets as a secure base from which to project power further in the region.” 21. Daugherty, Action, 206. Another feature of the program’s funding was that Executive Saudi Arabia had pledged matching funds to whatever the US Congress was prepared to appropriate. 22. Some media, along with a book and movie, have characterized the Afghan operation as “Charlie Wilson’s war” in view of his strong advocacy for the program. 23.

Attendance might expand depending on the topic and region. If other agencies, such as the FBI, DEA, or Department of Commerce had equities at stake, they might also be included. 30. According to one former NSC participant in covert action decisions, a senior congres- sional official might strongly object to a proposed finding, which raised the risk of a leak if the president went ahead with the operation. 31.
